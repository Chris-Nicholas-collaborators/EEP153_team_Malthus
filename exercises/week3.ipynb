Sometimes this is something we can check in advance.  For\nexample, if can find a value $a$ such that `f(a)` is positive and a\nvalue $b$ such that `f(b)` is negative, the continuity of the\nfunction (named) `f` gives us a mathematical guarantee that a zero\nof the function exists.  \n\nHowever, even for continuous unbounded functions there is no\nalgorithm that&rsquo;s guaranteed to locate a zero for *any* such\nfunction.  Some algorithms work better than others, and some are\ndesigned to work with particular classes of functions.\n\nOne quite robust (but often slow) method is a method called\n*bisection*.  This uses the idea above: start by finding values\n$(a,b)$  such that $f(a)>0>f(b)$.  Then if $f$ is continuous we\nknow there must be a zero on the real interval $[a,b]$.  Divide\nthis interval in half, and evaluate $f((a+b)/2)$.  If this is\npositive, then we know there must be a zero on the interval\n$[(a+b)/2,b]$; if negative, that there must be a zero on\n$[a,(a+b)/2]$.  Take this new smaller interval, and repeat.  Keep\ngoing until the evaluation of the function (named) `f` is close to\nzero.\n\nThe python package `scipy` includes a module `optimize` which\nincludes a variety of different routines to both find optima (i.e.,\nmaxima and minima) as well as closely related routines to find the\nzeros of functions.
