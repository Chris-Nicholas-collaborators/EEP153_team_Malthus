The column &ldquo;j&rdquo;\nshould include a household id; the column &ldquo;t&rdquo; should include an\nindicator for the year or period (for those of you with\ncross-sectional data these will all take a common value, e.g., 2019);\nthe column &ldquo;m&rdquo; should be an indicator of &ldquo;market&rdquo;, which may be a\nregion identifier, or may take a single value (e.g., &ldquo;Malawi&rdquo;).\n\nThe triple (j,t,m) will serve as the index of some constructed\ndataframes.  It is important not to have **too** many different values\nfor &ldquo;m&rdquo; (unless you have lots of RAM to play with).\n\nBeyond the first three columns, the &ldquo;Expenditures&rdquo; worksheet should\nhave one column for each category of expenditures (e.g., &ldquo;Rice&rdquo;, &ldquo;Goat\nmeat&rdquo;, &ldquo;Millet&rdquo;,&#x2026;).\n\nBeyond the first three columns, the &ldquo;Household Characteristics&rdquo; should\nhave columns corresponding to different elements of the vector of\nobservable characteristics $z$.
